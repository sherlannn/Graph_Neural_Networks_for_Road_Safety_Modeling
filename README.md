# Graph-Neural-Networks-for-Road-Safety-Modeling
Developed a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to predict traffic accidents by analyzing spatialtemporal patterns in road networks. Integrated road slope data as a novel feature to enhance
predictive accuracy. Conducted data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization,
achieving an improved ROC-AUC score (82.62% â†’ 83.22%) and higher precision in accident
prediction.
